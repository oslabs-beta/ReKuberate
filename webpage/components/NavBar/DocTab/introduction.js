        ReKuberate is a developer tool that allows you to seemlessly interact
        with your kubernetes clusters and nodes without the need to traverse
        through the terminal. With our tool you can visualize your clusters'
        health through our color-coded script that checks if either your 
        node is running, pending, or failed. Along with our visualizer tool, 
        Rekuberate also offers robust analytical graphs powered by the grafana/prometheus/helm
        stack that allows the user to intrept their local OM health and data availiability while 
        also allowing the user get a real-time data on the overall health the cluster
